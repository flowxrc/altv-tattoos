## Character tattoo system for alt:V Multiplayer
Convereted my old Rage:MP script for Alt:V

### Usage:
F8 (alt:V debug console):
 - addTattoo `index`: Adds a tattoo from list, returns true if removed, false if player already has that tattoo.
 - removeTattoo `index`: Removes a tattoo from list, returns true if removed, false if player does not have that tattoo.
